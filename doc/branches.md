Some info on current branches:

* `fs`: The main `FS` planner stable branch.
* `delayed`: Some quick&dirty refactoring from the `fs`branch to allow the necessary changes for the delayed evaluation version of LAPKT to compile.
* `fs-private`: The main `FS` planner experimental branch, branched from `fs` and with the latest, possibly untested and non-compiling, additions.
This branch is private and should not make it to the public repository until we want to make it public.
